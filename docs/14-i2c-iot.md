# I²C Communication in IoT Systems
 **I²C (Inter-Integrated Circuit)** is a serial communication protocol that enables multiple digital devices — such as microcontrollers, sensors, and displays — to communicate using only **two shared signal lines**.


It is one of the most widely used communication standards in Internet of Things (IoT) systems because it allows efficient, synchronized data transfer between a central controller (the master) and numerous peripheral devices (the slaves) with minimal wiring.


Typical IoT use cases include connecting **temperature sensors, OLED displays, accelerometers, real-time clocks, and air-quality monitors** to a single Raspberry Pi or microcontroller.


I²C combines the simplicity of **UART communication** (few wires) with the flexibility of **SPI** (multi-device support), making it ideal for sensor networks and embedded device clusters.
